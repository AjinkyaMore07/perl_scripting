# Sum of Odd Numbers in Perl
## Description

This Perl script calculates the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 20 using a for loop. It is a simple program designed to demonstrate basic Perl syntax, including loops, arithmetic operations, and printing results.
How It Works

  ### Initialization:
    A variable $sum is initialized to store the cumulative sum of odd numbers.

  ### Odd Number Iteration:
    A for loop is used to iterate through all odd numbers between 1 and 20. The loop starts at 1 and increments by 2 to skip even numbers.

  ### Summation:
    Each odd number is added to the $sum variable.

  # Output:
    The final result, i.e., the sum of all odd numbers, is printed to the terminal.
