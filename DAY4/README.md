# Palindrome Checker in Perl

A simple Perl script to check if a number is a **palindrome**.  
A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., 121, 1221, 12321).

## Features
- Accepts user input through the command line.
- Reverses the number using a `while` loop.
- Compares the reversed number with the original to determine if it's a palindrome.
- Provides clear, user-friendly output.

## **How to Run**

### Prerequisites

     ```
   - If Perl is not installed, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.perl.org/get.html) for installation instructions.

2. Run the script:

       perl palindrome_checker.pl
