# Even or Odd Checker in Perl
---

## Description
---   
    This is a simple Perl script that determines whether a given number is even or odd. The script prompts the user to enter a number, evaluates its parity, and displays the result.

# How It Works
---
    The script asks the user to input a number.
    It checks if the number is divisible by 2:
        If true, the number is even.
        If false, the number is odd.
    The result is displayed to the user.


# Example 
---    
    $ perl even_or_odd.pl
    enter a number to find even or odd: 7
    The number 7 is odd
    
    $ perl even_or_odd.pl
    enter a number to find even or odd: 12
    The number 12 is even
