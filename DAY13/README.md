# Retrieve the Last Element of an Array in Perl


## Description

  This Perl script demonstrates how to retrieve and print the last element of an array. It first calculates the index of the last element and prints it if the array is not empty. 
  This script is a basic yet essential practice for working with arrays in Perl.

## What You Will Learn

    Array Basics: Learn how to define and initialize arrays in Perl.
    Retrieve Last Element: Understand how to use the special array index $#array to fetch the last element.
    Conditional Check: Use a simple conditional statement to ensure the array is not empty before accessing its elements.

## Key Concepts

    Array Indexing:
        $#array gives the index of the last element of an array in Perl.
   
    Empty Array Check:
        Ensure the array is not empty (@array != 0) to prevent errors.

## Use Case

    This script can be used in scenarios where you need to retrieve the last element of an array dynamically, especially when the size of the array is unknown.
