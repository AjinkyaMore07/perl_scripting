# Welcome Message for a Specific Argument in Perl

## Description

This Perl script runs an infinite loop and checks if the provided argument matches the string "India". When the condition is met, it prints a welcoming message about India and exits the loop. 
This script demonstrates the use of infinite loops, argument handling, and conditional checks in Perl.

What I Learn

    Infinite Loops: Understand how to create and control an infinite loop in Perl using while(1).
    Command-Line Argument Handling: Learn how to access command-line arguments using @ARGV.
    Conditional Statements: Implement logic to check for specific input and take action.


## Key Concepts

    Infinite Loops: Useful for continuously waiting for specific conditions to be met.
    Conditional Logic: Add robust checks for user-provided input.
    
    Command-Line Arguments:
        Use $ARGV[0] to access the first argument passed to the script.
        
    Breaking Loops: Use last to exit a loop when a condition is satisfied.
