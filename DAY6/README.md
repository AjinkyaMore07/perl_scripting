# Write a program for the following loop concepts to print numbers 1 to 10 in ascending and descending order

## Concepts:

  (a) do-while loop:
        Use a do-while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10 in ascending order.
        A do-while loop executes the block of code at least once, even if the condition is false.

  (b) do-until loop:
        Use a do-until loop to print numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order.
        A do-until loop continues until a specific condition becomes true.
