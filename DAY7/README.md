# Perl Script for Printing Information on India
---

### Output:

    When you run the Perl script with the argument "INDIA", the output will be:

    -> India is also well known as the land of spirituality, philosophy, science, and technology.
Description:

This is a simple Perl script that checks for a specific argument passed to it (in this case, "INDIA") and, if the condition is met, prints out a statement about India. The script is designed to run in an infinite loop until the argument "INDIA" is passed, after which it exits with a message.
Features:

    A. String Comparison: The script compares the passed argument with the string "INDIA".
    B. Infinite Loop Handling: The script runs in an infinite loop (while(1)) until the correct argument is provided.
    C. Conditional Print: Upon receiving the correct argument, the script prints a message about India.
