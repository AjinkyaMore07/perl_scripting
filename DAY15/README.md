# Printing Array Elements Using a for Loop in Perl

## Description

    This Perl script demonstrates how to iterate through an array and print each element using a for loop. 
    It serves as an example of basic array manipulation and loop control in Perl.

## What I Learn

    Arrays in Perl: How to define and access array elements.
    for Loop: Using a for loop to iterate through an array.
    Indexing: Understanding the $#array operator to get the last index of an array.


## Key Concepts

    Array Definition: Use my @array to define an array.
    Looping with for:
        Initialize the loop with $_ = 0.
        Iterate until the index $#array (last index of the array).
    Array Indexing: Access each element of the array with $array[$_].

## Use Cases

    This script can be adapted for:

    Printing arrays element by element.
    Performing specific actions for each array element in a loop.
    Learning how to work with array indexing and loops in Perl.
